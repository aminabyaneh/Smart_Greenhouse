# Important Factors in a Greenhouse
This is the brief tutorial of how special parameters affect greenhouse and its plants.

### IOT Based Parameters
These parameters should be handled by using IOT based sensors and systems.
Using moving average algorithm. ZigBee protocol to ad-hoc communication.

#### Sensors:

* Carbon Di-Oxide
Electrochemical gas sensor
Advantages: high speed, real-time sensing, low power consumption, high contamination tolerance and small in size.
Disadvantages: carbon monoxide often coexists with CO2 and absorbs a similar wave-length range as CO2 which results in inaccurate readings. They are also very expensive.

* Temperature 
Type: Integrated Circuit (IC) Temperature sensors
Advantages: low cost, excellent linearity and easy-to-read output.
Disadvantages: limited temperature range, self-heating, fragile and slightly less accurate when compared to other types.

* Humidity
Type: Capacitive Humidity Sensors (CHSs)
Advantages: able to function in high temperature environments (up to 200°C), near linear voltage output, wide RH (Relative Humidity) range, high condensation tolerance, reasonable resistance to chemical vapors and contaminants, minimal long-term drift, high accuracy, small size and low cost
Disadvantages: limited sensing distance and sensor interface can be tedious and difficult.

* Light Intensity
Type: Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
Advantages: very cheap, fast response, linear output, and small in size.
Disadvantages: like photometric sensors, LDRs are mostly used to measure indoor lighting conditions.

* Soil Moisture
Type: Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) Soil Moisture Sensor
Advantages: highly accurate, fast response time and inexpensive
Disadvantages: need to be calibrated for the type of soil they will be buried in.
